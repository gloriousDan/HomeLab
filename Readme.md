# Homelab

This repo contains the docker compose files for hosting my HomeLab.  

This currently includes:
* [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
* [Tandoor-recipes](https://docs.tandoor.dev/)
* A static website which lists public transit departures near my home.

Renovate Bot is set up to automatically open pull requests when docker images are updated.
